# Magnetic-Bubble Logic Arrays: Domain-Bubble Motion Performing Computations

This document describes the principles, architecture, theoretical background, governing equations, operational logic, and design considerations for magnetic-bubble logic arrays—computation systems that use controlled motion of magnetic domain bubbles in garnet films to implement logic operations.

## 1. Concept and Motivation

* **Objective**: Harness the dynamics of magnetic domain bubbles—cylindrical regions of reversed magnetization—as mobile logic bits that propagate, interact, and perform Boolean operations in patterned magnetic fields.
* **Applications**: Radiation-hardened computing, non-volatile logic, low-power embedded controllers, magnetic memory-logic integration.
* **Advantages**:

  * **Non-volatile state** of bubbles retains data without power.
  * **Low energy** switching via magnetic field pulses rather than charge movement.
  * **Radiation resilience** due to robust magnetization states.

## 2. Device Architecture

### 2.1. Magnetic Bubble Medium

* **Material**: Thin-film garnet (e.g., yttrium iron garnet—YIG) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
* **Film thickness**: 1–10 µm, optimized to support stable cylindrical domain bubbles of diameter 1–10 µm.
* **Bias field**: Uniform perpendicular magnetic field $H_b$ to stabilize bubble size and mobility.

### 2.2. Patterned Conduit Structures

* **Guiding patterns**: Lithographically defined permalloy or garnet strips creating local field minima that channel bubble motion.
* **Interaction sites**: Intersection nodes where multiple conduits merge to implement logic gates.
* **Nucleation/Annihilation pads**: Regions for bubble creation (write) and deletion (erase) via local magnetic pulses.

### 2.3. Magnetic Field Drivers and Sensors

* **Drive coils or current lines**: Generate in-plane pulsed magnetic fields to propel bubbles along conduits.
* **Magnetoresistive sensors**: Detect presence/absence of bubbles at output nodes.
* **Control electronics**: Programmable pulse generators orchestrating bubble movement sequences.

## 3. Theoretical Background

### 3.1. Bubble Stability and Size

Equilibrium bubble diameter $D$ set by balance of wall energy and Zeeman energy:

$$
2\pi R \sigma_w =
\pi R^2 \mu_0 M_s H_b,
$$

where $R = D/2$, wall energy density $\sigma_w$, saturation magnetization $M_s$.

Solving:

$$
D = \frac{4\sigma_w}{\mu_0 M_s H_b}.
$$

### 3.2. Bubble Velocity under Field Pulses

For an in-plane field pulse $H_x$ of amplitude $H_p$ and duration $\tau_p$, bubble drifts with velocity:

$$
v = \frac{\gamma \Delta}{\alpha} H_p,
$$

where $\gamma$ is gyromagnetic ratio, $\alpha$ Gilbert damping, and $\Delta$ domain-wall width.

### 3.3. Bubble–Bubble Interaction

Two bubbles at separation $s$ experience interaction force:

$$
F_{int}(s) \approx -\frac{\mu_0 M_s^2 t}{2\pi} K_1\bigl(\frac{s}{\Delta}\bigr),
$$

with film thickness $t$ and modified Bessel function $K_1$, influencing logic gate dynamics.

## 4. Governing Equations and Logic Operations

### 4.1. Conduit Transport Equation

Bubble position $x(t)$ along conduit follows:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = \mu_m H_p(t) - \nu(x),
$$

where mobility $\mu_m = \gamma \Delta / \alpha$ and retardation $\nu$ from pattern potential.

### 4.2. Logic Gate Implementation

#### 4.2.1. AND Gate

* **Structure**: Two input conduits merge at a junction; only when both bubbles arrive simultaneously does interaction drive an output bubble nucleation.
* **Timing**: Field pulses synchronized so single bubbles annihilate or stray without generating output.

#### 4.2.2. OR Gate

* **Structure**: Conduits converge into shared pathway; any input bubble propagates to output via field pulses.

#### 4.2.3. NOT Gate (Inverter)

* **Structure**: Presence of input bubble diverts a default output bubble along alternate path via controlled field bias, producing opposite logic.

### 4.3. Sequential Logic and Memory

Bubbles can be gated into storage loops—closed conduits where circulating bubbles represent stored bits until a release pulse reads them.

## 5. Operational Logic Flow

1. **Initialization**: Apply global bias $H_b$ and clear film of residual bubbles.
2. **Write**: Nucleate input bubbles at input pads for bits “1”; skip for “0”.
3. **Propagate**: Apply sequential in-plane field pulses to move bubbles through conduits.
4. **Interact**: At logic junctions, bubbles merge or redirect per gate design.
5. **Read**: Sense bubble presence at output pads with MR sensors; reset conduits via annihilation pulses.
6. **Loop / Store**: Optionally route bubbles into storage loops for sequential operations.

## 6. Design Considerations and Challenges

* **Precise timing**: Field pulse synchronization critical for gate fidelity.
* **Thermal stability**: Temperature variations affect $\sigma_w$ and mobility; require thermal management.
* **Bubble pinning**: Surface roughness and defects can trap bubbles; high-quality films and patterns essential.
* **Scalability**: Feature sizes \~µm require advanced lithography; parallel field drivers increase complexity.
* **Speed vs. Power**: Stronger pulses increase speed but consume more energy; optimal tradeoff needed.
