## Acoustic Levitation Transport: Phased-Array Sound Manipulation for Micro-Component Conveyance

### Abstract

Acoustic levitation transport uses controlled ultrasonic standing waves generated by phased transducer arrays to trap, move, and assemble micro-components in mid-air. By dynamically adjusting phase delays across the array, focal nodes can be translated, enabling contactless conveyance in assembly lines. This document presents the concept, theoretical principles, governing equations, control logic, and implementation strategies for acoustic levitation-based micro-component transport systems.

### 1. Introduction

* **Acoustic Levitation:** Suspension of particles at pressure nodes of ultrasonic standing waves due to acoustic radiation forces.
* **Phased Array Control:** Electronic steering and shaping of acoustic fields via adjustable phase and amplitude at each transducer.
* **Micro-Assembly Applications:** Non-contact handling of delicate or contaminant-sensitive components during microscale manufacturing.

### 2. Concept and System Overview

1. **Transducer Array:** Two opposing planar arrays of ultrasonic transducers (frequency $f$ \~20–200 kHz) creating standing-wave field.
2. **Phased Control:** Each transducer driven with phase $\phi_i$ and amplitude $A_i$ to shape focal regions and move nodes.
3. **Particle Trapping:** Micro-components with size < $\lambda/2$ levitated at pressure nodes where primary radiation force balances gravity.
4. **Dynamic Transport:** Gradual phase shifts across the array translate nodes, carrying trapped particles along predefined trajectories.
5. **Feedback Mechanism:** Optical or ultrasonic sensors monitor particle position; control loop adjusts phases for precise placement.

### 3. Theoretical Foundations

#### 3.1 Acoustic Radiation Force

Time-averaged primary radiation force on a small spherical particle (radius $a$, $a \ll \lambda$) in standing wave:

$$
F_{rad} = -\frac{4\pi a^3 k E_{ac}}{3} \Phi \nabla \sin^2(kx)
$$

where:

* $k = 2\pi/\lambda$, $\lambda=c/f$
* $E_{ac} = p_0^2/(4\rho c^2)$: acoustic energy density ($p_0$: pressure amplitude)
* $\Phi = \frac{5\rho_p - 2\rho}{2\rho_p + \rho} - \frac{\kappa_p}{\kappa}$: acoustic contrast factor
* $\rho, \rho_p$: fluid and particle densities
* $\kappa, \kappa_p$: fluid and particle compressibilities

#### 3.2 Node Translation via Phase Control

For an array of N transducers at positions $x_i$, the total pressure field at point $x$:

$$
p(x,t) = \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \cos(k x - \omega t + \phi_i)
$$

Phase gradient $\Delta \phi$ shifts node position $\Delta x = \Delta \phi / k$. Continuous phase ramp moves nodes.

#### 3.3 Stability and Trapping Conditions

Equilibrium when net vertical force (acoustic + gravity + drag) equals zero:

$$
F_{rad}(x_0) - m_p g - 6\pi \mu a v = 0
$$

Trapping requires $F_{rad} \ge m_p g$ and sufficient lateral confinement via field shaping.

#### 3.4 Control Algorithm

PID control for phase adjustments based on position error $e = x_{target} - x_{meas}$:

$$
\phi_i(t+\Delta t) = \phi_i(t) + K_p e + K_i \int e dt + K_d \frac{de}{dt}
$$

Multiple nodes can be controlled independently via superposition of phase patterns.

### 5. Implementation Logic

1. **Array Design:** Select transducer count and spacing to cover workspace; design driver electronics for individual phase/amplitude control.
2. **Frequency Selection:** Choose ultrasonic frequency balancing particle size, desired node spacing, and attenuation in medium.
3. **Calibration:** Map phase patterns to node positions; measure $E_{ac}$ and $\Phi$ for target components.
4. **Sensing Integration:** Use high-speed cameras or ultrasonic detectors to localize particles in real-time.
5. **Control System:** FPGA or microcontroller implementing PID loops for each trap; generate phase patterns on DAC-driven phased-array.
6. **Assembly Line Integration:** Synchronize multiple trapping zones to hand off components between arrays or to tooling stations.
