# Electromagnetic Topological Logic (ETL)

## Abstract

Electromagnetic Topological Logic (ETL) encodes information and performs computation using topological defects (e.g., skyrmions, domain walls) in magnetic materials. By manipulating these defects via tailored electromagnetic fields, ETL offers robust, radiation-resistant logic operations, making it ideal for harsh environments like space.

## 1. Introduction & Motivation

Traditional charge-based logic suffers from radiation-induced bit-flips. Topological defects—due to their nontrivial winding numbers—are inherently stable against local perturbations. ETL harnesses this stability by:

* **Encoding**: Bits stored as presence, polarity, or chirality of skyrmions or domain walls.
* **Computation**: EM pulses move and interact defects, implementing logic gates.

## 2. Topological Defects in Magnetism

### 2.1. Skyrmions

Magnetic skyrmions are solitonic spin textures characterized by integer topological charge:

$$
Q = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int \mathbf{m} \cdot \bigl(\partial_x \mathbf{m} \times \partial_y \mathbf{m}\bigr)\,dxdy,
$$

where $\mathbf{m}(x,y)$ is the unit magnetization vector.

### 2.2. Domain Walls

Region boundaries between magnetic domains with distinct orientation. Characterized by wall angle $\phi_w$ and helicity.

## 3. Information Encoding

* **Binary 0/1**: presence (1) or absence (0) of a skyrmion in a nanotrack cell.
* **Ternary**: skyrmion polarity (up/down), absence.
* **Higher radix**: chirality angle as continuous variable.

## 4. Logic Gate Mechanisms

### 4.1. Skyrmion Collision Gate (AND)

Two input nanotracks merge; only when both skyrmions arrive simultaneously does their interaction form an output skyrmion in the result track.

* **Condition**: input skyrmions at positions $x_A,x_B$ collide at junction.
* **Output**: new skyrmion at track C if both present.

Truth table:

|  A  |  B  |  C  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |

### 4.2. Domain-Wall Majority Gate

Three input wires intersect; majority-polarity wall propagates to output.

### 4.3. NOT Gate via Defect Inversion

Apply localized EM field pulse to reverse skyrmion polarity or flip domain orientation.

## 5. Field–Defect Interaction Equations

### 5.1. Thiele Equation for Skyrmion Motion

Under applied current or field gradient, skyrmion velocity $\mathbf{v}$ satisfies:

$$
\mathbf{G} \times \mathbf{v} + D \alpha \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{F}_{ext} = 0,
$$

where:

* $\mathbf{G} = 4\pi Q\hat{z}$ gyrovector.
* $D$ damping tensor.
* $\alpha$ Gilbert damping.
* $\mathbf{F}_{ext} = \mu_0 M_s t (\nabla B)$ force from field gradient.

### 5.2. Domain Wall Dynamics

1D wall displacement $X(t)$ obeys:

$$
\frac{dX}{dt} = \frac{\gamma \Delta}{\alpha} H_{eff},
$$

with $\Delta$ wall width, $H_{eff}$ effective field.

## 6. Implementation Pathway

1. **Material selection**: chiral magnets (e.g., FeGe, MnSi) or multilayer stacks with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI).
2. **Nanofabrication**: define nanotrack arrays via e-beam lithography.
3. **Field generation**: microcoil arrays or spin–orbit torque lines to apply localized pulses.
4. **Readout**: tunneling magnetoresistance sensors to detect defect presence.

## 7. Advantages & Challenges

* **Radiation hardness**: topological stability resists cosmic rays.
* **Low-power**: defects move under small currents/fields.
* **Scalability**: potential densities >10¹² bits/cm².
* **Challenges**: precise control of defect nucleation and interactions; material uniformity.

## 8. Future Directions

* **3D logic architectures**: multilayer defect paths.
* **Hybrid systems**: integrate with CMOS for control logic.
* **Error correction**: implement defect-based parity checks.
