## Neutron-Flux Logic Elements: Radiation-Hardened State Switching via Controlled Neutron Pulses

### Abstract

Neutron-flux logic elements leverage controlled neutron irradiation to toggle bistable states in radiation-hardened materials, enabling logic operations in high-radiation environments (e.g., space, nuclear reactors). By designing materials and device geometries whose physical or magnetic properties change upon neutron-induced transmutation or defect generation, one can implement non-volatile, radiation-resilient logic gates. This document describes the concept, theoretical mechanisms, governing equations, device logic, and implementation considerations for neutron-flux logic elements.

### 1. Introduction

* **Neutron Radiation Effects:** Fast neutrons interact with nuclei, causing atomic displacements, transmutations, and defect formation.
* **Logic Element Principle:** Use neutron-induced changes (e.g., resistivity, magnetization) in target materials as switchable states.
* **Applications:** Logic in nuclear plants, space electronics, radiation sensors with embedded logic.

### 2. Concept and Device Overview

1. **Active Material:** Radiation-tunable compound (e.g., doped semiconductors, ferromagnetic alloys, phase-change ceramics) whose property $P$ shifts upon neutron fluence $\Phi_n$.
2. **Bistable States:** Define thresholds $\Phi_{set}, \Phi_{reset}$ that toggle element between state 1 (e.g., low resistivity) and state 0 (high resistivity).
3. **Neutron Delivery:** Pulsed neutron source (e.g., compact accelerator or isotope) directs localized flux to specific elements.
4. **Readout Circuit:** Radiation-hardened sense amplifiers or Hall sensors detect material state.
5. **Logic Gate Topology:** Combine multiple elements in transistor-like or relay-like networks to create AND, OR, NOT functions based on neutron pulse patterns.

### 3. Theoretical Foundations

#### 3.1 Neutron-Matter Interactions

Neutron-induced displacement rate (displacements per atom, dpa):

$$
D = \Phi_n \sigma_d
$$

where:

* $\Phi_n$: neutron fluence (n/cm²)
* $\sigma_d$: displacement cross-section (cm²)

Defect density $N_d = D N_{atom}$.

#### 3.2 Property Change Dynamics

Material property $P$ (resistivity $\rho$, coercivity $H_c$, phase fraction) evolves with defect density:

$$
\Delta P(\Phi_n) = P_0 \left[1 - e^{-\alpha \Phi_n}\right]
$$

with saturation coefficient $\alpha$.

#### 3.3 Threshold Switching

Set (1) when $\Phi_n \ge \Phi_{set}$ such that $P$ crosses threshold $P_{th}
$. Reset (0) via thermal annealing or secondary neutron pulse to drive transmutation reversing effect at $\Phi_{reset}$.

#### 3.4 Logic Gate Implementation

* **Neutron-AND Gate:** Two elements in series: both must receive set fluence to conduct.
* **Neutron-OR Gate:** Elements in parallel: any set element connects output.
* **Neutron-NOT Gate:** Material with opposite response (increase resistivity upon irradiation) used as inverter.

### 4. Core Equations Summary

1. **DPA Rate:** $D=\Phi_n \sigma_d$
2. **Defect Density:** $N_d = D N_{atom}$
3. **Property Shift:** $\Delta P = P_0[1 - e^{-\alpha \Phi_n}]$
4. **Set Condition:** $\Phi_n \ge \Phi_{set},\; \Delta P(\Phi_{set}) = P_{th}$
5. **Reset via Anneal:** $P(T,t)$ follows thermal recovery kinetics
6. **Gate Logic:** Series/parallel connect based on conduction state.

### 5. Implementation Logic

1. **Material Selection:**

   * Semiconductors (SiC, GaN) doped for radiation tunability
   * Magnetic alloys (FePt) whose coercivity changes under neutron defects
2. **Element Fabrication:**

   * Microfabricate resistor or Hall element arrays on radiation-hard substrates.
3. **Neutron Source Integration:**

   * Miniaturized accelerator or encapsulated radioisotope shielded with collimators for directed pulses.
4. **Thermal Annealing Reset:**

   * On-chip microheaters restore material to baseline state.
5. **Readout Electronics:**

   * Radiation-hardened ASICs measure resistivity or Hall voltage.
6. **System Control:**

   * Sequence neutron pulses and anneals to execute logic operations in clocked cycles.

### 6. Potential Applications

* Logic controllers for nuclear reactor monitoring
* Radiation-hardened state machines in space probes
* Secure one-time-programmable memory (neutron write-once)
* Embedded logic in radiation sensors for hazard mapping

### 7. Conclusion

Neutron-flux logic elements exploit neutron-induced material changes to realize radiation-resilient, non-volatile logic gates. Through careful material engineering, neutron delivery, and reset mechanisms, these devices provide robust computation in extreme environments.
