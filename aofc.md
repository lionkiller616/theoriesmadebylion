# All-Optical Feedback Control

**Abstract**

All-Optical Feedback Control (AOFC) systems use purely photonic elements—lasers, optical cavities, modulators, and detectors—to sense, process, and actuate mechanical systems without electronics. By closing feedback loops in the optical domain, AOFC achieves ultrafast response, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and integration with photonic circuits for precision stabilization of micro- and nanoscale mechanics.

### 1. Introduction

* **Motivation**: Electronic feedback loops introduce latency, noise, and EMI susceptibility. AOFC replaces electronic signal paths with optical channels, leveraging the speed and bandwidth of light for high-performance control.
* **Applications**: Optomechanical resonators, MEMS stabilization, vibration isolation, atomic force microscopy, laser frequency stabilization using movable mirrors or membranes.

### 2. Core Concept

1. **Optical Sensing**: A probe laser interrogates mechanical displacement via interferometry, cavity resonance shifts, or scattering intensity. The output optical signal encodes the system state.
2. **Optical Processing**: The sensed light is routed through optical components—filters, amplifiers (optical gain mediums), and nonlinear elements—that implement proportional, integral, or derivative actions.
3. **Optical Actuation**: The processed light drives a second optical beam that exerts radiation pressure, photothermal forces, or the photoelectric effect on the mechanical element to correct deviations.
4. **Feedback Loop**: The sensing and actuation beams share a common optical path or interact in a cavity to complete the loop purely in the optical domain.

### 3. Theoretical Foundations

#### 3.1 Optomechanical Interaction

Hamiltonian for a single-mode cavity coupled to a mechanical mode:

$$
H = \hbar \omega_c a^\dagger a + \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_m^2 x^2 - \hbar G a^\dagger a x,
$$

Where:

* $a, a^\dagger$: cavity photon operators
* $x, p$: mechanical displacement and momentum
* $\omega_c, \omega_m$: cavity and mechanical resonant frequencies
* $G = \frac{d\omega_c}{dx}$: optomechanical coupling rate

#### 3.2 Linearized Dynamics

Around a steady-state intracavity field $\alpha$, define fluctuations $\delta a, \delta x$. Linearized equations in the frequency domain:

$$
(-i(\Delta - \omega) + \kappa/2) \delta a(\omega) = i G \alpha \delta x(\omega) + \sqrt{\kappa_{\text{in}}} \, \delta a_{\text{in}}(\omega)
$$

$$
- m \omega^2 \delta x(\omega) + i m \omega \Gamma_m \delta x(\omega) + m \omega_m^2 \delta x(\omega) = \hbar G (\alpha^* \delta a(\omega) + \alpha \delta a^\dagger(\omega))
$$

Where:

* $\Delta$: detuning of the laser from the cavity
* $\kappa$: cavity linewidth
* $\Gamma_m$: mechanical damping rate

#### 3.3 Optical PID Implementation

* **Proportional**: Use an optical attenuator with adjustable gain $G_p$ to scale sensed light intensity.
* **Integral**: Optical delay line and resonant cavity feedback integrate errors over a time constant $\tau_i$.
* **Derivative**: Optical differentiator using resonant micro-rings or fiber Bragg gratings generates phase-shifted components proportional to $\frac{d}{dt}$ of input.

Transfer function in Laplace domain (purely optical):

$$
H_{\text{opt}}(s) = G_p + \frac{G_i}{s} + G_d s
$$

This is realized by cascading photonic elements with tailored amplitude and phase responses.

### 4. System Architecture

* **Sensing Arm**: Laser → interferometer or cavity → photonic filter → waveguide splitter

* **Control Network**: Integrated photonic circuit with tunable micro-ring resonators, optical amplifiers (e.g., SOAs), and optical delay lines

* **Actuation Arm**: Controlled laser beam directed onto the mechanical element; methods include:

  * **Radiation Pressure**: High-power beam inside a cavity
  * **Photothermal**: Absorptive coating converts light to heat, inducing mechanical stress
  * **Opto-Electronic**: Photodiode generates voltage to drive piezoelectric actuators (hybrid approach)

* **Loop Closure**: Optical isolators and circulators manage beam routing to avoid back-reflections

---

### 5. Performance Metrics

* **Loop Bandwidth**: Determined by slowest photonic component (e.g., optical delay), potentially >100 MHz
* **Latency**: Sub-nanosecond optical propagation vs. microsecond-scale electronic processing
* **Noise Floor**: Shot-noise-limited detection; no Johnson or amplifier noise
* **Stability**: Gain and phase margins set by photonic transfer functions

### 6. Workflow

1. **Modeling**:

   * Derive optomechanical transfer functions and required controller response
   * Simulate optical filter responses (e.g., FDTD or coupled-mode theory)

2. **Photonic Design**:

   * Layout waveguide circuits, select resonator $Q$-factors, amplifier gains
   * Design cavity and beam paths for sensing and actuation

3. **Fabrication**:

   * Use silicon photonics or III–V platforms for integrated circuits
   * Fabricate mirrors and cavities via MEMS processes

4. **Integration**:

   * Align lasers, couplers, and photonic chip
   * Tune laser detuning and cavity phases

5. **Testing**:

   * Inject mechanical disturbances; record closed-loop suppression
   * Measure loop transfer functions optically using network analysis
   * Optimize controller parameters via photonic element tuning

### 7. Equations Summary

$$
H = \hbar \omega_c a^\dagger a + \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_m^2 x^2 - \hbar G a^\dagger a x
$$

$$
(-i(\Delta - \omega) + \kappa/2) \delta a(\omega) = i G \alpha \delta x(\omega) + \sqrt{\kappa_{\text{in}}} \delta a_{\text{in}}(\omega)
$$

$$

$$

$$
H_{\text{opt}}(s) = G_p + \frac{G_i}{s} + G_d s
$$
