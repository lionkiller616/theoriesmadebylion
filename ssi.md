**Superconducting Spintronics Interconnects: Lossless Magnetic Data Lanes Between Cryo-Chips**

---

## Abstract

We introduce **Superconducting Spintronics Interconnects (SSI)**: hybrid transmission lines that carry spin-polarized currents in a superconducting environment for ultralow-loss, high-bandwidth on‑chip and chip-to-chip communication at cryogenic temperatures. By combining superconducting waveguides with spintronic materials, SSI offers magnetic data channels with minimal dissipation and picosecond latency.

## 1. Introduction

Cryo‑electronics (quantum processors, superconducting logic) demands interconnects that preserve signal integrity at millikelvin to kelvin temperatures. Conventional metal lines exhibit resistive losses and crosstalk. We propose **SSI** to realize:

* **Lossless Transmission:** zero Ohmic loss via superconductors
* **Spin-based Signaling:** immunity to electromagnetic interference
* **Cryo-compatibility:** seamless integration with dilution refrigerators

**Keywords:** superconductivity, spintronics, magnonics, cryogenic interconnect, Josephson spin valve

## 2. Unique Concept

1. **Superconducting Waveguide Core:** NbTi or NbN microstrip guides carrying spin-polarized supercurrents.
2. **Spin Injector/Detector:** ferromagnetic insulator (e.g. yttrium iron garnet, YIG) interfaced via spin Hall effect layers (Pt)
3. **Magnon–Polariton Coupling:** coherent transfer between spin waves (magnons) and superconducting microwave photons.
4. **Josephson Spin Valve Junctions:** gateable spin filters providing logic-level modulation.

## 4. Theoretical Principles

### 4.1 Superconducting Spin Transport

* **Spin-polarized supercurrent** through a ferromagnet in proximity:
  $I_s = I_c \sin\phi \; ,$
  where *φ* is the superconducting phase difference.
* **Usadel equations** for diffusive S–F–S junctions:
  $\frac{D}{2} \nabla (\hat{G}\nabla \hat{G}) + i[\epsilon \hat{\tau}_3 + \hat{h},\hat{G}] = 0 ,$
  with Green’s function *Ĝ*, exchange field *ĥ*, diffusion constant *D*.

### 4.2 Magnon–Photon Coupling

* **Hamiltonian:**
  $H = \hbar \omega_m m^\dagger m + \hbar \omega_{ph} a^\dagger a + \hbar g_{mp}(a m^\dagger + a^\dagger m),$
  where *ω\_m*, *ω\_ph* are magnon and photon frequencies, *g\_mp* coupling.
* **Strong coupling criterion:**
  $g_{mp} > \frac{\kappa + \gamma}{2} ,$
  with photon loss *κ* and magnon damping *γ*.

### 4.3 Josephson Spin Valve Dynamics

* **Critical current modulation:**
  $I_c(θ) = I_{c0} \bigl|\cos\tfrac{θ}{2}\bigr| ,$
  *θ* relative magnetization angle in S–F–F–S junction.

1. **Magnetic Biasing:** On-chip coils tune ferromagnetic state.
2. **Phase Encoding:** Data encoded in superconducting phase *φ* and magnon population.
3. **Demodulation:** Homodyne detection of microwave photons post-coupling yields digital bits.

## 6. Fabrication & Assembly

1. **Substrate:** Sapphire or silicon with superconducting film (NbN) by sputtering.
2. **Ferromagnetic Layers:** YIG grown by pulsed laser deposition, patterned via e-beam lithography.
3. **Spin Hall Layers:** Pt thin film (5 nm) for injection/detection.
4. **Waveguide Patterning:** Photolithography + reactive-ion etching.
5. **Josephson Junctions:** Nb–AlOx–Nb trilayer junctions with integrated ferromagnet.
