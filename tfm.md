# Toroidal Flux Memory

## Abstract

A non-volatile memory architecture leveraging quantized magnetic flux trapped in superconducting nano-toroids. Information is stored as integer multiples of the flux quantum $\Phi_0 = h/2e$. Write operations inject or remove fluxons via control coils; read operations sense the trapped flux inductively. Arrays of such cells promise ultra-high density, radiation hardness, and near-zero standby energy.

## 1. Introduction

Conventional memory technologies (DRAM, Flash) face scaling limits, volatility, and radiation sensitivity. Superconducting flux-based storage offers:

* **Quantized states**: robust against analog drift.
* **Non-volatility**: no power required to maintain flux.
* **Radiation hardness**: superconductors screen charged particles.

## 2. Cell Structure & Materials

* **Superconducting toroid**: ring of superconducting material (e.g., Nb or YBCO) with inner radius $r_i$ and outer radius $r_o$.
* **Control coil**: tightly coupled wound coil for write pulses.
* **Sense coil**: magnetically coupled for nondestructive reads.

## 3. Flux Quantization & Storage States

### 3.1. Flux Quantum

Magnetic flux in a superconducting loop is quantized:

$$
\Phi = n\,
\Phi_0,
\quad
\Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e} \approx 2.07\times10^{-15}\ \mathrm{Wb},
$$

where $n\in\mathbb{Z}$.

### 3.2. State Encoding

Each toroid holds $n$ fluxons. For binary storage, use $n=0$ ("0") or $n=1$ ("1"). Multi-bit cells choose higher $n$.

## 4. Write Operation

* **Pulse amplitude** $I_w$ generates flux $\Phi_w = M_w I_w$ through mutual inductance $M_w$.
* **Threshold condition**: to change $n$ by $\Delta n$, pulse must satisfy:

$$
M_w I_w = \Delta n\,\Phi_0 + \Delta \Phi_{loss},
$$

accounting for losses $\Delta \Phi_{loss}$.

* **Pulse shaping**: rise time $\tau_r$ minimizes hysteresis-induced overshoot.

## 5. Read Operation

* **Sense voltage**: a small AC current $i_s(t)$ in the sense coil induces a voltage

$$
V_s(t) = -M_s \frac{dI_{toroid}}{dt},
$$

where $M_s$ is mutual inductance and $I_{toroid}=\Phi/(L)$.

* **Flux extraction**: measure peak amplitude at frequency $\omega_s$ to infer $n$:

$$
V_{peak} \propto n\,\Phi_0\,\omega_s/L.
$$

## 6. Cell Array & Scaling

* **2D array**: toroids on a grid with shared word and bit lines for coils.
* **Pitch**: nano-toroids (diameter \~100 nm) allow >10¹² bits/cm².
* **Isolation**: superconducting ground planes and magnetic shielding prevent crosstalk.

## 7. Governing Equations Summary

1. **Flux quantization**: $\Phi=n\,\Phi_0$.
2. **Write coupling**: $\Phi_w=M_w I_w$.
3. **Read voltage**: $V_s = -M_s dI_{toroid}/dt$.
4. **Toroid inductance**: $L = \mu_0 r_\mathrm{avg}[\ln(8r_\mathrm{avg}/a)-2]$ for wire radius $a$.

## 8. Implementation Pathway

1. **Fabrication**: electron-beam lithography to define nano-toroids in superconducting thin films.
2. **Coil integration**: multi-layer planar coils patterned via lift-off.
3. **Cryogenic testing**: characterize write/read pulses in a dilution refrigerator.
4. **Array demonstration**: build a prototype array (e.g., 10×10) and verify endurance and retention.

## 9. Applications

* Cryogenic memory for quantum computers.
* Spaceborne storage in radiation-rich environments.
* Ultra-dense archival storage with zero standby power.
