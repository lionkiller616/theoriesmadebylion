## Thermo-Elastic Logic Latches

**Abstract**

Thermo-Elastic Logic Latches (TELLs) utilize controlled heat pulses to switch bistable micro-cantilever elements between two stable positions, encoding digital states. By exploiting the thermo-elastic coupling in micro-structured beams, TELLs achieve low-energy, non-volatile mechanical memory and logic operations without electronic charge movement.

### 1. Introduction

* **Motivation**: As conventional CMOS approaches fundamental limits, alternative mechanical and thermal logic paradigms offer non-volatility, radiation hardness, and energy efficiency at the microscale.
* **Applications**: Harsh-environment computing, energy-harvesting logic, integration into MEMS sensors for in-sensor pre-processing.

### 2. Core Concept

1. **Bistable Cantilever**: A micro-cantilever with pre-stressed bilayer (e.g., metal–polymer) exhibits two stable configurations (up/down) due to buckling.
2. **Thermal Actuation**: Localized resistive heaters deliver heat pulse $Q$ to the bilayer, inducing thermo-elastic stress and causing snap-through between states.
3. **State Reading**: Optical, piezoresistive, or capacitive sensors detect cantilever deflection to read logic state.
4. **Logic Latch Operation**: Input heat pulses correspond to SET or RESET commands, toggling the mechanical state.

### 3. Theoretical Foundations

#### 3.1 Thermo-Elastic Stress

For a bilayer beam, differential expansion generates curvature:

$$
\kappa(T) = \frac{6(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2)\Delta T}{t(1 + \frac{E_1 t_1}{E_2 t_2})},
$$

where:

* $\alpha_i, E_i, t_i$: thermal expansion coefficient, Young’s modulus, and thickness of layer $i$
* $t = t_1 + t_2$, $\Delta T$ temperature change

#### 3.2 Buckling and Bistability

Critical Euler buckling load for a fixed–fixed beam:

$$
P_{cr} = \frac{4\pi^2EI}{L^2},
$$

with flexural rigidity $EI$ and length $L$. Post-buckled equilibrium positions satisfy nonlinear beam equations; two stable deflections $\pm w_0$.

#### 3.3 Heat Pulse Dynamics

Transient heat equation in beam:

$$
\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \dot{q}(t),
$$

where $\rho, c_p, k$ are density, specific heat, thermal conductivity, and $\dot{q}(t)$ is heater power density.

Thermal time constant:

$$
\tau_{th} = \frac{\rho c_p V}{h A_s},
$$

with surface convection coefficient $h$, beam volume $V$, surface area $A_s$.

### 4. Logic Operation and Timing

* **SET (1)**: Apply heat pulse $Q_{set}$ such that $\Delta T > \Delta T_{th,up}$ triggers snap to upper state.
* **RESET (0)**: Apply reversed or localized pulse $Q_{reset}$ on opposite side for snap to lower state.
* **Hold**: No power input; bistable beam retains state indefinitely.
* **Switching Time**: Roughly $t_{sw} \approx 2\tau_{th} + t_{mech}$, where $t_{mech}$ is mechanical transition time.

### 5. Device Architecture

* **Cantilever Geometry**: Length $L$, width $b$, bilayer thicknesses chosen for target bistable curvature.
* **Heater Integration**: Thin-film resistive elements patterned on cantilever surface with electrical contacts.
* **Sensing Elements**: Piezoresistor or interdigitated capacitor at cantilever base to sense deflection.
* **Array Configuration**: Multiple latches tiled with shared addressing lines for heater and sense circuits.

### 6. Performance Metrics

* **Energy per Switch**: $E = \int_0^{t_p} P(t) dt \approx C_{th} \Delta T^2 / 2$.
* **Retention Time**: Infinite (non-volatile) as long as ambient remains below buckling-reversal temperature.
* **Switching Frequency**: Limited by thermal relaxation $~1/\tau_{th}$, typically kHz regime.
* **Endurance**: Mechanical fatigue of bilayer; estimated >10^9 cycles with proper material choice.

### 7. Workflow for Implementation

1. **Simulation**:

   * Finite-element thermal–structural coupling to optimize geometry and material stack.
2. **Fabrication**:

   * Deposit bilayer films (e.g., Ti/SiN) on silicon substrate.
   * Pattern cantilevers, heaters, and sensor structures via lithography and etching.
3. **Characterization**:

   * Calibrate heater power vs. $\Delta T$ using IR microscopy.
   * Measure switching thresholds and times under pulsed actuation.
   * Test state retention over temperature and time.
4. **Integration**:

   * Interface with control electronics for addressable heat pulses and readout.
   * Demonstrate logic functions (e.g., SR latch, D latch) by combining multiple TELL elements.

### 8. Equations Summary

$$
\kappa(T) = \frac{6(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2)\Delta T}{t(1 + \frac{E_1 t_1}{E_2 t_2})},
$$

$$
P_{cr} = \frac{4\pi^2EI}{L^2},
$$

$$
\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \dot{q}(t),
$$

$$
E \approx \tfrac12 C_{th} \Delta T^2, \quad \tau_{th} = \frac{\rho c_p V}{h A_s}.
$$

### 9. Future Directions

* Explore multi-stable beams for ternary logic.
* Integrate with energy-harvesting heaters (e.g., thermoelectric) for autonomous operation.
* Scale to NEMS for GHz-speed switching through plasmonic heating.
