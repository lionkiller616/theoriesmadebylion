# Muon-Tomography Security Scanners: 
**Cosmic Muons Imaging Dense Cargo Non-Invasively**

---

## 1. Introduction

Muon tomography leverages naturally occurring, highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons to non-invasively probe the interior of large or dense objects. By tracking muon trajectories before and after passage through cargo or structures, one reconstructs 3D density maps, detecting high-atomic-number materials (e.g., nuclear contraband). This passive, radiation-free technique offers an alternative to X‑ray scanners for security and customs inspections.

**Aim:** Outline the principles, theoretical foundation, governing equations, and logical workflow for muon-tomography security scanners.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

1. **Cosmic Muons:**

   * Secondary particles from cosmic-ray showers at Earth’s atmosphere, flux ≈ 10⁴ m⁻²·min⁻¹ at sea level.
   * Mean energy \~4 GeV; highly penetrating (meters of steel).

2. **Tomographic Principle:**

   * Record incoming ($\mathbf{p}_{in}$) and outgoing ($\mathbf{p}_{out}$) muon tracks using position-sensitive detectors above and below the object.
   * Scattering angles correlate with local material density (via multiple Coulomb scattering).

3. **Applications:**

   * Inspect shipping containers, vehicles, and critical infrastructure.
   * Detect nuclear materials, dense shielding, and structural defects.

## 3. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Multiple Coulomb Scattering

Highland’s formula:

\[
\sigma_\theta \approx \frac{13.6\,\text{MeV}}{\beta p} \sqrt{\frac{L}{X_0}} \left[1 + 0.038\ln\left(\frac{L}{X_0}\right)\right],
\]


Where:

* $p$ is the muon momentum,
* $\beta = v/c$,
* $X_0$ is the radiation length,
* $\sigma_\theta$ is the RMS scattering angle.

### 3.2 Scattering Tomography Reconstruction

Define the scattering density $\lambda(\mathbf{r}) \propto 1/X_0(\mathbf{r})$. For each muon $k$, measure deviation angle $\theta_k$. Solve the inverse problem:

\[
\theta_k^2 \approx \int_{\text{track}_k} w(s)\,\lambda(\mathbf{r}(s))\,ds,
\]

where $w(s)$ is the path weighting. Aggregate many muons to reconstruct $\lambda(\mathbf{r})$ on a voxel grid via iterative algorithms (e.g., Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization).

## 4. Equations & Logic Flow

1. **Detector calibration:**

   * Determine spatial resolution $\delta x, \delta y$ and angular resolution $\delta \theta$.

2. **Track reconstruction:**

   * Fit straight lines to hits in upper ($z_1$) and lower ($z_2$) detector planes to get $\mathbf{p}_{\text{in}}, \mathbf{p}_{\text{out}}$.

3. **Scattering angle computation:**

   \[
   \theta = \arccos\left(\hat{\mathbf{p}}_{\text{in}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{p}}_{\text{out}}\right)
   \]

4. **Voxelization:**

   * Divide volume into a 3D grid; initialize $\lambda_i = \lambda_0$.

5. **Forward projection:**

   \[
   \bar{\theta}_k^2 = \sum_i w_{ki}\,\lambda_i
   \]

6. **Back-projection update (EM):**

   \[
   \lambda_i^{(n+1)} = \lambda_i^{(n)} \cdot \frac{1}{\sum_k w_{ki}} \sum_k w_{ki} \cdot \frac{\theta_k^2}{\bar{\theta}_k^2}
   \]

7. **Iterate** until convergence.

## 5. Practical Implementation Notes

* **Detector Technologies:**

  * Gas-based drift tubes, resistive plate chambers (RPCs), or scintillator panels with silicon photomultipliers.
* **Spatial & Timing Resolution:**

  * Sub-millimeter spatial, nanosecond timing to reduce track ambiguity and background.
* **Data Acquisition:**

  * Continuous muon flux; accumulation times from minutes to hours depending on desired resolution.
* **Shielding & Background:**

  * Shield detectors from stray radiation; account for noise from low-energy particles.

## 6. Conclusion

Muon-tomography scanners exploit cosmic muons’ deep penetration and scattering signatures to non-invasively image dense cargo. By reconstructing 3D scattering-density maps via tomographic inversion, one can detect concealed high-$Z$ materials with high sensitivity, offering a passive, safe inspection method for security applications.
