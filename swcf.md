# Spin-Wave Computing Fabric: Magnonic Networks Processing Data via Spin-Wave Interference

This document details the concept, architecture, theoretical foundations, governing equations, operational logic, and design considerations for spin-wave computing fabrics—magnonic networks that perform information processing by exploiting spin-wave (magnon) propagation and interference in magnetic media.

## 1. Concept and Motivation

* **Objective**: Leverage spin waves (collective excitations in magnetic lattices) to implement logic operations and signal processing with ultra-low energy dissipation and high parallelism.
* **Applications**: Beyond-CMOS computing, neuromorphic processors, RF signal processing, non-Boolean computing, hardware accelerators for AI.
* **Advantages**:

  * **Low power**: Magnonic propagation incurs minimal Joule heating compared to charge currents.
  * **Wave-based parallelism**: Interference and phase-based logic allow dense, reconfigurable networks.
  * **Frequency multiplexing**: Multiple channels can coexist at different frequencies or wavevectors.

## 2. Fabric Architecture

### 2.1. Magnetic Waveguide Network

* **Material**: Low-damping magnetic insulators (e.g., yttrium iron garnet—YIG) or doped garnets.
* **Waveguides**: Patterned strips or channels supporting planar spin-wave modes.
* **Nodes and Junctions**: Junctions where waveguides intersect or split for signal routing and interference.

### 2.2. Spin-Wave Excitation and Detection

* **Exciters**: Microwave antennas or current-driven spin–orbit torque (SOT) inject spin waves with defined amplitude and phase.
* **Detectors**: Inverse SOT devices, magnetoresistive sensors, or optical techniques (Brillouin light scattering) read out spin-wave signals.

### 2.3. Control Elements

* **Phase shifters**: Local magnetic field bias or voltage-controlled anisotropy regions tune wave phase velocity.
* **Amplitude modulators**: Localized damping modulation via spin valves or voltage-controlled magnetic damping.
* **Reconfigurable gates**: Electrically switchable regions that guide or block spin waves, implementing logic functions.

## 3. Theoretical Background

### 3.1. Spin-Wave Dispersion

The dispersion relation for plane spin waves in a thin ferromagnetic film under bias field $H_0$:

$$
\omega(k) = \gamma \sqrt{(H_0 + D k^2)(H_0 + D k^2 + M_s)},
$$

where:

* $\gamma$: gyromagnetic ratio
* $D$: exchange stiffness constant (units: m$^2$/s)
* $k$: spin-wave wavevector magnitude
* $M_s$: saturation magnetization

### 3.2. Wave Propagation and Attenuation

Amplitude decays as:

$$
A(x) = A_0 \exp(-\alpha k x),
$$

where $\alpha$ is the Gilbert damping parameter.

### 3.3. Interference and Logic Encoding

Two spin waves $ \psi_1 = A_1 e^{i(\omega t - kx)}$ and $ \psi_2 = A_2 e^{i(\omega t - kx + \phi)}$ combine at junction to give:

$$
\Psi_	ext{tot} = \psi_1 + \psi_2 = (A_1 + A_2 e^{i\phi}) e^{i(\omega t - kx)}.
$$

Constructive ($\phi = 0$) and destructive ($\phi = \pi$) interference represent logic “1” and “0”.

## 4. Governing Equations and Logic Operations

### 4.1. Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) Equation

Magnetization dynamics in each waveguide element follow:

$$
rac{d\mathbf{M}}{dt} = -\gamma \mathbf{M} 	imes \mathbf{H}_	ext{eff} + rac{\alpha}{M_s} \mathbf{M} 	imes rac{d\mathbf{M}}{dt},
$$

where $\mathbf{H}_	ext{eff}$ includes external bias, exchange, and anisotropy fields.

### 4.2. Logic Gate Implementation

* **Majority Gate**: Three input waveguides converge; output phase determined by majority of input phases.
* **AND/OR Gates**: Configured via asymmetric amplitude weighting and phase control.
* **XOR Gate**: Mach–Zehnder-like interferometer with differential phase shift region.

### 4.3. Signal Routing and Fan-Out

Spin-wave splitters divide amplitude across multiple outputs with conservation of energy:

$$
A_	ext{each} = rac{A_	ext{in}}{\sqrt{N}} e^{-\alpha k L_s},
$$

where $N$ outputs separated by splitter junction and $L_s$ is splitter length.

## 5. Operational Logic Flow

1. **Initialization**: Apply global bias field $H_0$ and set phase references.
2. **Input Encoding**: Drive exciters with microwave pulses encoding bits in phase.
3. **Wave Propagation**: Spin waves travel through waveguide network, interacting at junctions.
4. **Interference-Based Logic**: Junction outputs represent logic operations via interference pattern.
5. **Output Detection**: Sensors convert local spin-wave amplitude/phase to electrical signals.
6. **Reconfiguration**: Dynamic tuning of phase shifters and switches for different algorithms.

## 6. Design Considerations and Challenges

* **Damping Minimization**: Choose materials and geometries to reduce $\alpha$ and extend propagation length.
* **Frequency Selectivity**: Employ bandpass structures to isolate distinct logic channels.
* **Thermal Stability**: Maintain constant temperature to avoid dispersion shifts.
* **Integration with CMOS**: Develop hybrid interfaces for signal conversion and control.
* **Scalability**: Balance waveguide density with crosstalk and fabrication tolerances.
