# Entangled Field Theory (EFT)

## Abstract

Entangled Field Theory (EFT) proposes that under tailored resonant conditions, electromagnetic (EM) fields can maintain macroscopic entanglement between spatially separated antennas. This entanglement enables lossless, instantaneous energy transfer across large distances, forming the basis for global wireless power grids without decay.

## 1. Premise & Motivation

Traditional EM propagation experiences attenuation, dispersion, and resistive losses. EFT asserts:

* **Macroscopic field entanglement**: Coherent states in distant resonators remain quantum-correlated.
* **Resonant inoculation**: Carefully matched cavities/antennas sustain entanglement via continuous coupling to a shared squeezed reservoir.

## 2. Fundamental Mechanism

### 2.1. Paired Antenna Setup

* **Emitter and receiver**: Two superconducting loop antennas (A and B) with identical resonance $\omega_0$.
* **Squeezing source**: Central nonlinear medium supplies two-mode squeezed vacuum at $\omega_0$ into both antennas.

### 2.2. Entanglement Maintenance

The joint state of the two resonators: a two-mode squeezed state

$$
|\Psi\rangle = S_{AB}(r)\,|0,0\rangle,
$$

where the squeeze operator

$$
S_{AB}(r) = \exp\bigl[r(\hat{a}_A\hat{a}_B-\hat{a}_A^\dagger\hat{a}_B^\dagger)\bigr].
$$

Continuous injection of squeezing counters decoherence, preserving entanglement.

## 3. Governing Equations

1. **Resonator dynamics**:

   $$
   \dot{\hat{a}}_A = -i\omega_0\hat{a}_A - \kappa\hat{a}_A + \sqrt{2\kappa}\,\hat{a}_{in,A},
   $$

   similarly for $\hat{a}_B$.

2. **Two-mode squeezing input**:

   $$
   \langle \hat{a}_{in,A}(t)\hat{a}_{in,B}(t')\rangle = M\,\delta(t-t'),
   $$

   with squeeze parameter $M=\sinh r\cosh r$.

3. **Energy transfer rate**:

   $$
   P_{transfer} = \hbar\omega_0 \kappa \,\sinh^2 r,
   $$

   maximizing at optimal squeeze $r^*$.

4. **Loss suppression**: Effective decoherence rate reduced:

   $$
   \Gamma_{eff} = \Gamma_0 e^{-2r}.
   $$

## 4. Logical Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Tune antennas A and B to identical $\omega_0$.
2. **Squeeze injection**: Pump central nonlinear medium at frequency $2\omega_0$ to generate entangled photons.
3. **Field locking**: Phase-lock both resonators via feedback from homodyne detectors.
4. **Energy dispatch**: Modulate amplitude in A; B receives correlated energy instantaneously.

## 5. Implementation Pathway

1. **Resonator fabrication**: Superconducting planar loops with Q-factors $>10^6$.
2. **Nonlinear medium**: Josephson parametric amplifier or optical parametric oscillator for microwave/optical regimes.
3. **Feedback control**: Low-latency electronics for homodyne-based phase stabilization.
4. **Demonstration**: Lab-scale (meters) energy transfer tests; scale to kilometers with phased arrays.

## 6. Potential Applications

* Cable-free power delivery to remote locations.
* Space-based solar power with direct entangled downlinks.
* Secure energy channels immune to eavesdropping.
