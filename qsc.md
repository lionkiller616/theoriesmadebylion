# Quantum-Spacetime Coupling (QSC) Theory

## Abstract

The Quantum-Spacetime Coupling (QSC) theory posits that spacetime curvature influences local quantum coherence lengths. Massive bodies warp spacetime and modulate the effective decoherence rates of quantum states. This interplay offers new insights into dark matter, coherence stabilization near extreme gravitational wells, and testable predictions via qubit behavior in varying gravitational potential.

## 1. Premise & Motivation

General relativity describes how mass–energy curves spacetime; quantum mechanics governs the coherence of microscopic states. QSC bridges these domains by asserting:

* **Coherence length $\xi$** depends on local spacetime metric $g_{\mu\nu}$.
* **Curvature coupling**: stronger curvature (higher Ricci scalar $R$) reduces ambient vacuum fluctuations, altering decoherence.

Motivations include unexplained astrophysical phenomena (dark matter effects) and the search for stable quantum systems in gravitational gradients.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1. Metric-Dependent Coherence

Define coherence length as:

$$
\xi(g) = \xi_0 \exp\bigl(-\alpha\,\ell_P^2 R\bigr)
$$

where:

* $\xi_0$: baseline coherence in flat space.
* $\alpha$: dimensionless coupling constant.
* $\ell_P = \sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}$: Planck length.
* $R = g^{\mu\nu}R_{\mu\nu}$: Ricci scalar curvature.

### 2.2. Decoherence Rate Modification

Decoherence rate $\Gamma$ inversely scales with $\xi$:

$$
\Gamma(g) = \Gamma_0 \bigl[1 + \beta\,\log(\xi_0/\xi(g))\bigr]
$$

* $\Gamma_0$: flat-space decoherence.
* $\beta$: phenomenological constant.

### 2.3. Dark Matter as Entanglement Residue

Expanding spacetime stretches entangled pairs, reducing local coherence and manifesting as additional gravitational lensing. Effective density:

$$
\rho_{DM}(r) \propto \int T_{00}(r')\, e^{-\gamma\,R(r')}\,d^3r'
$$

with $\gamma$ governing decay of entanglement contributions.

## 3. Predictions & Implications

1. **Coherence Wells**: Regions near compact masses (neutron stars, black holes) create pockets where $R\gg0$ leads to enhanced $\xi$; quantum systems there experience reduced $\Gamma$.
2. **Dark Matter Signature**: Galactic rotation curves correlate with spacetime-curvature-weighted entanglement density, not unseen mass.
3. **Lab-Scale Tests**: High-precision qubits at different altitudes (varying $R$ from Earth’s gravity) exhibit measurable $\Delta\Gamma$.

## 4. Governing Equations Summary

1. **Coherence length**: $\xi = \xi_0 e^{-\alpha \ell_P^2 R}$.
2. **Decoherence rate**: $\Gamma = \Gamma_0[1+\beta\ln(\xi_0/\xi)]$.
3. **Entanglement mass density**: $\rho_{DM} \propto \int T_{00} e^{-\gamma R}\,d^3r$.

## 5. Experimental Pathways

1. **Celestial Qubit Decoherence**: Deploy quantum sensors on satellites passing near Earth and higher orbits; measure $\Gamma$ vs. local curvature.
2. **Neutron Star Probe**: Observe naturally occurring quantum transitions (e.g., in pulsar magnetospheres) for anomalous coherence lifetimes.
3. **Terrestrial Altitude Series**: Compare superconducting qubit decoherence at mountain top vs. sea level to detect subtle $R$-dependent shifts.

## 6. Challenges & Future Work

* Determining coupling constants $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ from theory or fitting to data.
* Extending to full quantum field in curved spacetime formalism.
* Integrating with quantum gravity proposals for a unified framework.
