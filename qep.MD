# Quantum Entropic Potential (QEP)

## Abstract

Quantum Entropic Potential (QEP) theory establishes a direct relationship between entropy gradients in a system and an induced electromagnetic scalar potential. Expressed as:

$$
\phi = -\frac{\hbar}{e} \nabla S,
$$

where $S$ is entropy density, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $e$ is the elementary charge. This predicts voltage generation from entropy changes without conventional charge separation mechanisms.

## 1. Premise & Motivation

Thermoelectric and thermomagnetic effects show that temperature and entropy gradients can drive currents. QEP extends these ideas by:

1. Treating entropy density $S(\mathbf{r})$ as a fundamental field with associated potential $\phi$.
2. Proposing that $\nabla S$ directly induces an electrostatic potential via quantum principles.

Applications include novel energy harvesting in materials, entropy-driven electronics, and deepening the link between thermodynamics and electromagnetism.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1. Entropy as a Field

Define entropy density:

$$
S(\mathbf{r},t) = -k_B \mathrm{Tr}[\rho \ln \rho],
$$

where $\rho$ is the local density matrix of the quantum system.

### 2.2. Entropic Potential Definition

Postulate:

$$
\phi(\mathbf{r},t) = -\frac{\hbar}{e} \nabla S(\mathbf{r},t).
$$

* Dimensions: $[\phi]=\mathrm{V}$ since $[\nabla S]=\mathrm{J/(K\,m)}$ and $\hbar/e$ has units $\mathrm{J\cdot s/C}$.

### 2.3. Modified Electrodynamics

Include QEP in Poissonâ€™s equation:

$$
\nabla^2 \phi = -\frac{\rho_e}{\varepsilon_0} + \frac{\hbar}{e} \nabla^2 S,
$$

where $\rho_e$ is free charge density.

## 3. Governing Equations

1. **Entropic potential**: $\phi=-\tfrac{\hbar}{e} \nabla S$.
2. **Modified Poisson**: $\nabla^2\phi=-\rho_e/\varepsilon_0 + (\hbar/e)\nabla^2S$.
3. **Current density**: induced current due to $\nabla S$:

   $$
   \mathbf{J}_S = -\sigma \nabla \phi = \frac{\sigma\hbar}{e} \nabla(\nabla S),
   $$

   where $\sigma$ is conductivity.

## 4. Physical Interpretation & Logic

* **Entropy-driven EMF**: Regions of high entropy gradient behave like voltage sources.
* **Quantum origin**: Factor $\hbar$ signals quantum-coherent influence of entropy variations.
* **No net charge separation**: Unlike Seebeck effect, QEP arises inherently from information-theoretic gradients.

## 5. Experimental Pathways

1. **Thermoelectric films**: Measure open-circuit voltage in materials where conventional Seebeck is suppressed but entropy gradients remain.
2. **Cold-trap experiments**: Create entropy fronts in ultracold atomic gases; detect induced potentials.
3. **Nanostructured devices**: Engineer entropy landscapes via nanopatterned disorder and record voltage responses.

## 6. Potential Applications

* Entropy-harvesting sensors.
* Information-to-energy transducers in computing circuits.
* Novel calorimetric voltage standards.
