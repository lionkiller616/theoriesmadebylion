# Resonant-Mode Hashing

**Abstract**

Resonant-Mode Hashing (RMH) is a novel technique that maps digital data blocks to unique radio-frequency (RF) resonant signatures for secure storage and retrieval. By encoding data in the resonant properties of tunable RF cavities or metamaterial resonators, RMH provides an inherently physical cryptographic layer, resistant to digital tampering and offering tamper-evident features.

### 1. Introduction

* **Motivation**: Traditional cryptographic hashing relies on mathematical transformations; RMH embeds data into physical resonances, coupling information security with hardware characteristics.
* **Applications**: Secure key storage, anti-counterfeiting tags, tamper-evident archives, physical unclonable functions (PUFs).

### 2. Core Concept

1. **Data Partitioning**: The data stream is divided into fixed-size blocks $D_i$.
2. **Resonator Tuning**: Each block $D_i$ is used to tune an RF resonator (e.g., cavity, LC circuit, metamaterial cell) to a characteristic resonant frequency $f_i$.
3. **Signature Extraction**: The measured resonance profile (frequency, quality factor, amplitude) constitutes the physical hash $H_i$.
4. **Verification**: To verify or retrieve data, the stored resonance is measured and compared against the expected signature.

### 3. Theoretical Foundations

#### 3.1 RF Resonance Model

An RF resonator can be modeled as a parallel RLC circuit with impedance:

$$
Z(\omega) = \frac{R}{1 + jQ\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_0} - \frac{\omega_0}{\omega}\right)}
$$

* $\omega_0 = 2\pi f_0$: natural angular resonant frequency
* $Q = \frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}$: quality factor

The resonance peak occurs at $\omega = \omega_0$.

#### 3.2 Data-to-Frequency Mapping

Define a bijective mapping $\Phi: \{0,1\}^n \to [f_{min}, f_{max}]$ such that each $n$-bit block corresponds to a unique frequency:

$$
f_i = \Phi(D_i) = f_{min} + \frac{(f_{max}-f_{min})}{2^n - 1} \cdot \text{int}(D_i)
$$

where $\text{int}(D_i)$ interprets the block as an integer.

#### 3.3 Quality Factor Encoding

Optionally, additional bits can be encoded in resonance bandwidth via targeted quality factor adjustments:

$$
Q_i = Q_{base} + \Delta Q(D_i^{\prime})
$$

where $D_i^{\prime}$ are auxiliary bits.

### 4. Hash Function Definition

The physical hash $H_i$ is defined as the tuple:

$$
H_i = \bigl(f_i, Q_i, A_i\bigr)
$$

* $f_i$: resonant frequency
* $Q_i$: quality factor
* $A_i$: peak amplitude (for tamper detection)

A composite hash for a sequence of blocks is:

$$
H = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{M} H_i
$$

where $\oplus$ denotes concatenation or a more complex mixing operation.

### 5. Security Analysis

1. **Collision Resistance**: The continuous nature of $f_i$ and high resolution of tuning makes accidental collisions highly unlikely.
2. **Tamper Evidence**: Physical alteration of a resonator (e.g., temperature, deformation) shifts $f_i$ or $Q_i$.
3. **Cloning Resistance**: Reproducing exact physical characteristics of a resonator array is non-trivial, offering PUF-like security.

### 6. Implementation Details

* **Resonator Array**: Microstrip cavities or MEMS-based LC resonators on a substrate.
* **Tuning Mechanism**: Varactors or MEMS capacitors controlled by digital-to-analog converters.
* **Measurement Setup**: Vector network analyzer (VNA) or integrated RF transceiver measures S-parameters.
* **Digital Interface**: Microcontroller programs tuning settings and reads measurements.

### 7. Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Fabricate resonator array and calibrate baseline $(f_0^{(j)}, Q_0^{(j)})$.
2. **Hashing**:

   * For each block $D_i$, compute $f_i$ and $Q_i$.
   * Program resonator $j=i$ to $(f_i, Q_i)$.
   * Measure $H_i$ and store digitally.
3. **Verification**:

   * Re-measure each resonator.
   * Compute deviation $\Delta f = |f_i^{meas} - f_i^{exp}|$.
   * Accept if $\Delta f < \epsilon_f$ and $\Delta Q < \epsilon_Q$.

### 8. Equations Summary

$$
\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}, \quad Q = \frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}.
$$

$$
f_i = f_{min} + \frac{f_{max}-f_{min}}{2^n - 1} \cdot \text{int}(D_i)
$$

$$
H_i = \bigl(f_i, Q_i, A_i\bigr), \quad H = \bigoplus_i H_i.
$$

### 9. Future Directions

* Multi-dimensional encoding using higher-order modes.
* Integration with photonic resonators for hybrid hashing.
* Nano-scale implementations for chip-level security.
