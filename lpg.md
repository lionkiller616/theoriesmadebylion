## Laser-Patterned Wireless Power Grids

**Abstract**

Laser-Patterned Wireless Power Grids (LPWPG) utilize dynamically reconfigurable optical beamforming networks to deliver concentrated laser energy to receiver modules in midair, enabling spatially distributed charging of drones, sensors, and IoT devices without physical contacts. By steering and shaping multiple laser beams via phased arrays or spatial light modulators, LPWPG create a power grid that adapts to device locations and power demands in real time.

### 1. Introduction

* **Motivation**: Conventional wireless power transfer (WPT) methods (inductive, resonant) are limited in range and require close proximity. Free-space optical WPT with lasers offers long-range, directed energy delivery but typically targets single devices. LPWPG extend this to multi-user, dynamic grids.
* **Applications**: Autonomous drone charging stations, smart building sensors, emergency power delivery, remote IoT networks.

### 2. Core Concept

1. **Transmitter Array**: A 2D array of laser emitters (VCSELs or fiber-coupled lasers) with precise phase and amplitude control.
2. **Beamforming**: Digital control of emitter phases $\phi_{mn}$ and amplitudes $A_{mn}$ to steer and focus beams at target locations $(x_k,y_k,z_k)$.
3. **Receiver Modules**: Photovoltaic receivers (laser power modules) with tracking systems to maintain alignment and maximize coupling efficiency.
4. **Dynamic Grid Management**: Real-time tracking of device positions and power requirements via a networked control system, adjusting beam patterns to supply multiple devices simultaneously.

### 3. Theoretical Foundations

#### 3.1 Optical Beamforming

Far-field electric field produced by an $M\times N$ array at point $\mathbf{r}$:
$E(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{n=1}^N A_{mn} e^{j(\phi_{mn} - k \hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot \mathbf{r}_{mn})},$
where:

* $\mathbf{r}_{mn}$: position of $(m,n)$ emitter
* $k = 2\pi/\lambda$
* $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$: unit vector toward target.

To focus at $\mathbf{r}_0$, set phase:
$\phi_{mn} = k \|\mathbf{r}_0 - \mathbf{r}_{mn}\|.$

#### 3.2 Power Coupling Efficiency

Receiver aperture area $A_r$ intercepts power density $I(\mathbf{r}_0) = \tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{Re}(E H^*)$. For ideal focus:
$\eta_{geom} = \frac{A_r}{A_{beam}},\quad A_{beam} = \pi w_0^2,$
with beam waist $w_0$.

Photovoltaic conversion efficiency $\eta_{pv}$. Total end-to-end efficiency:
$\eta_{tot} = \eta_{opt} \times \eta_{geom} \times \eta_{pv},$
where $\eta_{opt}$ is transmitter optical efficiency.

#### 3.3 Multi-User Multiplexing

Superposition of $K$ foci:
$E(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{mn} A_{mn}^{(k)} e^{j(\phi_{mn}^{(k)} - k \hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot \mathbf{r}_{mn})}.$
Power allocation constraint per emitter:
$|A_{mn}|^2 \le P_{max}/(MN).$
Optimization via convex programming to allocate phases and amplitudes minimizing sidelobes and meeting each user’s power demand $P_k$.

### 7. Equations Summary

$E(\mathbf{r}_0) = \sum_{mn} A_{mn} e^{j(\phi_{mn} - k \hat{\mathbf{r}}_0\cdot \mathbf{r}_{mn})},$
$\phi_{mn} = k \|\mathbf{r}_0 - \mathbf{r}_{mn}\|,$
$\eta_{tot} = \eta_{opt} \times \frac{A_r}{\pi w_0^2} \times \eta_{pv},$
$E(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{k} \sum_{mn} A_{mn}^{(k)} e^{j(\phi_{mn}^{(k)} - k \hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot \mathbf{r}_{mn})}.$
