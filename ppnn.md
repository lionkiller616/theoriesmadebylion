## Piezo-Photonic Neural Nets

**Abstract**

Piezo-Photonic Neural Nets (PPNNs) integrate piezoelectric sensors with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in closed-loop photonic circuits to realize self-learning hardware. Mechanical stimuli generate electrical signals via piezoelectric transducers that drive LEDs; emitted photons are detected by photodiodes or optical waveguides, providing feedback for adaptive synaptic weighting. Through on-chip learning rules implemented in analog photonic and piezoelectric domains, PPNNs perform sensory processing and associative learning with minimal electronic control.

### 1. Introduction

* **Motivation**: Conventional neural hardware relies on digital processing; PPNNs embed sensing, actuation, and learning in a monolithic piezo-photonic platform for ultralow-power, sensory–actuator coupling.
* **Applications**: Tactile sensing with haptic feedback, adaptive vibration control, bioinspired robotics, edge AI with mechanical stimuli.

### 2. Core Concept

1. **Piezoelectric Transducer Array**: Mechanical deformation $S_j$ at element $j$ produces voltage $V_j = g_{33} S_j t_p$, where $g_{33}$ is piezoelectric coefficient and $t_p$ thickness.
2. **LED Actuators**: Each voltage $V_j$ drives an LED with emission intensity $I_j \propto \eta_{ext} (V_j - V_{th})$.
3. **Photonic Coupling**: Photons from LED $i$ propagate to multiple photodiodes or waveguide couplers, producing currents $I_{ph,k} = R_{pd} \Phi_{i\to k}$, where $R_{pd}$ is photodiode responsivity and $\Phi_{i\to k}$ optical coupling efficiency.
4. **Adaptive Weights**: Variable optical attenuators or tunable piezo elements modulate coupling efficiencies $w_{ik}$.
5. **Learning Loop**: Local photonic and piezoelectric feedback implements Hebbian or spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules by adjusting $w_{ik}$ via voltage-driven strain in piezoelectric weight elements.

### 3. Device Architecture

* **Layered Stack**: Piezoelectric film (e.g., PZT or AlN) beneath an LED matrix, overlaid with photodiode detectors and tunable waveguide network.
* **Interconnects**: Optical waveguides with thermo-optic or piezo-optic modulators for weight control.
* **Control Circuitry**: Minimal CMOS for thresholding, initialization, and global coordination.

### 4. Theoretical Foundations

#### 4.1 Piezoelectric Voltage Generation

$$
V_j = g_{33} S_j t_p,
$$

where:

* $S_j$: mechanical strain
* $g_{33}$: piezoelectric voltage constant
* $t_p$: piezo layer thickness

#### 4.2 LED Emission Intensity

Assuming current $I_j$ flows when $V_j > V_{th}$:

$$
I_j = I_s \bigl(e^{qV_j/(nkT)} - 1\bigr), \quad I_{opt,j} = \eta_{ext} I_j.
$$

#### 4.3 Photocurrent Generation

$$
I_{ph,k} = R_{pd} \sum_i w_{ik} I_{opt,i}.
$$

#### 4.4 Synaptic Update Rule

Implementing an analog Hebbian rule:

$$
\Delta w_{ik} = \alpha I_{ph,k} \cdot V_j - \beta w_{ik},
$$

* $\alpha$: learning rate
* $\beta$: decay constant

Or STDP-inspired timing rule:

$$
\Delta w_{ik} = \begin{cases}
A_+ e^{-\Delta t/\tau_+}, & \Delta t > 0 \\
- A_- e^{\Delta t/\tau_-}, & \Delta t < 0
\end{cases}
$$

where $\Delta t = t_{post} - t_{pre}$.

### 5. Performance Metrics

* **Energy Efficiency**: $E_{node} = \frac{1}{2} C_p V_j^2 + E_{LED}$.
* **Latency**: Determined by LED rise/fall time and photonic propagation delay.
* **Learning Speed**: Time constant of weight modulation via piezo-optic response.

### 6. Workflow

1. **Fabrication**:

   * Deposit piezoelectric thin film on substrate.
   * Pattern bottom electrodes, grow LED array.
   * Integrate photodiodes and optical waveguides.
   * Add tunable attenuators (piezo-optic or thermo-optic).
2. **Characterization**:

   * Calibrate piezo-to-voltage transfer $g_{33}, t_p$.
   * Measure LED I–V and optical output versus $V_j$.
   * Map photodiode responsivities and coupling $\Phi_{i\to k}$.
3. **Training**:

   * Apply mechanical stimuli sequences.
   * Monitor photonic feedback currents and adjust $w_{ik}$ per learning rule.
4. **Evaluation**:

   * Test pattern recognition or adaptive filtering tasks.
   * Analyze accuracy, energy per inference, and retention.

### 7. Equations Summary

$$
V_j = g_{33} S_j t_p,
$$

$$
I_{opt,i} = \eta_{ext} I_s (e^{qV_j/(nkT)} - 1),
$$

$$
I_{ph,k} = R_{pd} \sum_i w_{ik} I_{opt,i},
$$

$$
\Delta w_{ik} = \alpha I_{ph,k} V_j - \beta w_{ik}.
$$

### 8. Future Directions

* Hybrid integration with CMOS for mixed-signal control.
* Multi-modal sensing combining piezo, thermal, and photonic inputs.
* Scaling to large arrays for complex machine-learning tasks.
* Bio-compatible versions for direct neural interfacing.
