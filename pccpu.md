## Photonically Cooled CPUs: Micro-LED Arrays for Localized Thermal Radiation

### Abstract

Photonically cooled CPUs embed micro-scale light-emitting diode (LED) arrays within or above integrated circuits to actively radiate thermal energy from processor hot spots. By converting waste heat into photons in targeted regions, these systems reduce local temperature, improve performance, and augment conventional conduction and convection cooling. This document outlines the concept, theoretical principles, governing equations, design logic, and implementation strategies for photonic CPU cooling.

### 1. Introduction

* **Thermal Challenges in CPUs:** High power densities create localized hot spots that limit clock speeds and reliability.
* **Photonics for Cooling:** Direct conversion of thermal excitations into radiative emission can bypass thermal resistance bottlenecks.
* **Micro-LED Arrays:** Arrays of sub-millimeter LEDs integrated on-chip to absorb and re-emit thermal energy as photons.

### 2. Concept and Design Overview

1. **Micro-LED Placement:** Tiles of LEDs positioned above known hot-spot regions (ALUs, caches) on CPU die or heat spreader.
2. **Thermal-to-Photon Conversion:** LEDs operate in reverse-bias (thermophotonic mode), absorbing thermal carriers to emit photons.
3. **Photon Extraction:** Emitted light is directed into high-emissivity cavities or waveguides to escape the chip package.
4. **Active Control:** Temperature sensors feed back to LED drive circuits, modulating bias to maintain target temperatures.
5. **Integration with Cooling Loop:** Photonic emission complements liquid or air cooling, reducing thermal load.

### 3. Theoretical Foundations

#### 3.1 Thermophotonic Emission

In reverse-bias, LED junctions absorb phonons and emit photons. Emission rate per unit area:

$$
M(\lambda,T) = A(\lambda) \frac{c}{\lambda^4} \frac{1}{e^{hc/(\lambda k_B T)}-1}
$$

where:

* $A(\lambda)$: spectral absorptivity/emissivity of LED junction
* $T$: junction temperature
* $\lambda$: wavelength

#### 3.2 Energy Balance

Local heat flux removal by photonic emission:

$$
q_{rad} = \int_0^\infty hc/\lambda \; M(\lambda,T) \, d\lambda
$$

Total cooling power combines radiative and conductive components:

$$
Q_{total} = Q_{rad} + k_{th}(T_{hot}-T_{sink})/L
$$

where $k_{th}$ is thermal conductivity, $L$ thickness.

#### 3.3 LED Efficiency and Bandgap

Photon emission requires overcoming LED bandgap $E_g$:

$$
\lambda_g = \frac{hc}{E_g}, \quad \eta_{rad} = \frac{\text{emitted photon power}}{\text{absorbed thermal power}}
$$

Optimal $E_g$ tuned to junction temperature to maximize emission.

#### 3.4 Control Loop Dynamics

Feedback control for junction temperature $T_j$:

$$
P_{drive}(t+\Delta t) = P_{drive}(t) + K_p (T_j - T_{set}) + K_i \int_0^t (T_j - T_{set}) dt
$$

PID gains $K_p, K_i$ tuned for stability.

### 4. Core Equations Summary

1. **Spectral Emission:** $M(\lambda,T) = A(\lambda)c/\lambda^4 [e^{hc/(\lambda k_BT)}-1]^{-1}$
2. **Radiative Flux:** $q_{rad}=\int hc/\lambda\,M(\lambda,T)d\lambda$
3. **Total Cooling Power:** $Q_{total}=Q_{rad}+k_{th}(T_{hot}-T_{sink})/L$
4. **Bandgap Wavelength:** $\lambda_g=hc/E_g$
5. **Radiative Efficiency:** $\eta_{rad}=P_{photon}/P_{thermal}$
6. **PID Control:** $P_{drive}(t+\Delta t)=P_{drive}+K_p\Delta T+K_i\int\Delta Tdt$

### 5. Implementation Logic

1. **LED Fabrication:** Grow III-V LED structures on silicon via wafer bonding or direct epitaxy; pattern micro-LED arrays (\~10–100 µm per pixel).
2. **Thermal Interface:** Embed LEDs in thin dielectric layer between die and heat spreader; ensure good thermal coupling.
3. **Optical Extraction:** Coat top surface with reflective cavity and photonic crystal outcoupler to direct photons out of package.
4. **Drive Electronics:** Integrate per-pixel current sources controlled by temperature sensor network and microcontroller or FPGA.
5. **System Integration:** Couple emitted light into fiber optic or transparent lid; combine with conventional heatsink or cold plate.
6. **Calibration:** Characterize LED emission vs. temperature and drive current; optimize bandgap and spectral emissivity.

### 6. Potential Applications

* High-performance CPUs and GPUs with extreme power densities
* Data center processors requiring fine-grained thermal management
* Power electronics and GaN devices with local hot-spot mitigation
* Flexible electronics where conventional heatsinks are impractical

### 7. Conclusion

Photonically cooled CPUs leverage micro-LED arrays in thermophotonic mode to directly convert heat into light from hot spots, offering a complementary cooling channel to conduction and convection. Through spectral tuning, active control, and optical extraction, this approach promises enhanced thermal management for next-generation high-power chips.
